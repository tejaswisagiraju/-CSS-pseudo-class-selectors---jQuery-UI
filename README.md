# CSS pseudo class selectors / jQuery-UI

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. 
 
Syntax example: 
```
  selector:pseudo-class {
    property: value;
  } 
  ```
  
Some of the selectors include: hover, before, after, n-child, link, visited, active </br>

jQuery UI is away to make your html elements more interactive and some examples include dragging and resizing.
